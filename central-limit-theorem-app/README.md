# Central Limit Theorem Demonstration

This application demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) using a graphical representation of random samples and their means. The CLT states that the distribution of the sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.

## Project Structure

- `src/index.js`: Entry point of the application.
- `src/components/Chart.js`: Component for rendering the graphical representation of the data.
- `src/utils/math.js`: Utility functions for mathematical calculations.
- `package.json`: Configuration file for npm.
- `.babelrc`: Babel configuration file.
- `.eslintrc.json`: ESLint configuration file.

## Getting Started

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd central-limit-theorem-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you will be able to visualize the Central Limit Theorem by generating random samples and observing how their means converge to a normal distribution as the sample size increases.
