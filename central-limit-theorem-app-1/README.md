# Central Limit Theorem Demonstration

This project demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) through a simple web application. The application allows users to visualize how the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases.

## Project Structure

## Getting Started

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd central-limit-theorem-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Open the application**:
   Open `src/index.html` in your web browser to view the application.

## Overview of the Central Limit Theorem

The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sample means will approach a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. This theorem is fundamental in statistics and underpins many statistical methods.

## Usage

- Adjust the sample size and number of samples to see how the distribution of sample means changes.
- Visualize the results with the provided graphs.
